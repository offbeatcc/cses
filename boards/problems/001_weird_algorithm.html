# Weird Algorithm

## Hailstone Sequence

The sequence of integers generated in this problem, for example,

\[
3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
\]

is also known as *hailstone sequence*, *hailstone numbers*, *wondrous
numbers*, etc.


## Collatz Conjecture

No matter what the value of \( n \) is, the sequence will always reach
\( 1 \).


## Observations

Note that the sequence begins to repeat after reaching 1.

\[
3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, \dots
\]

Specifically, as soon as the sequence reaches \( 4 \), we have
repetition:

\[
4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ...
\]
