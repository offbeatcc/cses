Each pair of numbers joined with lines sum to \( k + k + 11 = 2k +
11\).

The numbers joined with lines at the top can be printed as the first
set.

The numbers joined with lines at the bottom can be printed as the
second set.

## Terminology

Consider \( [k \, .. k + m - 1] \) as the input where \( m \equiv 0
\pmod{4} \).

In each result set we will include a pair of integers as illustrated
in the previous illustration. The sum of integers in each pair is \( k
+ k + m - 1 = 2k + m - 1 \).

We call the two integers in each pair complements of each other, i.e.,
for an integer \( i \) belonging to \( [k \, .. k + m - 1] \), we say
that the complement of \( i \) is \( 2k + m - 1 - i \).


## Solution

For each \( i \) in \( [k \, .. k + m/4) \), print \( i \) and its
complement as the first set.

For each \( i \) in \( [k + m/4 \, .. k + m/2) \), print \( i \) and
its complement as the second set.
