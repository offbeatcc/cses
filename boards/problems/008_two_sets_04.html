# Two Sets: Solution for \( [1 \, .. n] \)

When \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), solve as discussed previously with \(
k = 1 \) and \( m = n \).

When \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \),
  * put \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) in the first result set,
  * put \( 3 \) in the second result set, and
  * then solve for \( [4 \, .. n] \) as discussed previously with \( k =
    4 \) and \( m = n - 3 \).

## Illustration for \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \)
