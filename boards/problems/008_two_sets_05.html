# Two Sets: Adding Each Integer to the Set With Smaller Sum

## Solution Algorithm

For each integer \( k \) in \( [n \, .. 1] \), if the sum of integers
in the first set is less than or equal to the sum of integers in the
second set, add \( k \) to the first set; otherwise add \( k \) to the
second set.

<pre>
<code>12    9 &rarr; 8   5 &rarr; 4   1        (set 1)
 &darr;    &uarr;   &darr;   &uarr;   &darr;   &uarr;
11 &rarr; 10   7 &rarr; 6   3 &rarr; 2        (set 2)</code>

## Illustration for \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \)

<pre>
<code>11   8 &rarr; 7   4 &rarr; 3             (set 1)
 &darr;   &uarr;   &darr;   &uarr;   &darr;
10 &rarr; 9   6 &rarr; 5   2 &rarr; 1         (set 2)</code>

## Outline of Proof of Solution for Any \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \)

We first show that we can obtain a valid solution for \( n = 4 \) by
following the solution algorithm.

```
4 1    (set 1)
3 2    (set 2)
```

For \( n \ge 8 \), we add the integers \( n, (n - 1), (n - 2), (n - 3)
\) into the two sets by following the solution algorithm.

```
n    n-3    (set 1)
n-1  n-2    (set 2)
```

Then we solve the problem for \( n - 4 \). We keep repeating this
until we reach \( n = 4 \).


## Outline of Proof of Solution for Any \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \)

We first show that we can obtain a valid solution for \( n = 3 \) by
following the solution algorithm.

```
3      (set 1)
2 1    (set 2)
```

For \( n \ge 7 \), we add the integers \( n, (n - 1), (n - 2), (n - 3)
\) into the two sets by following the solution algorithm.

```
n    n-3    (set 1)
n-1  n-2    (set 2)
```

Then we solve the problem for \( n - 4 \). We keep repeating this
until we reach \( n = 3 \).
