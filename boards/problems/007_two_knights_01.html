# Two Knights: Incremental Solution: Cases

Let us assume we know the result for \( k = 5 \). In fact, it is \(
252 \).

Let us now compute the *increment* in the result when we go from \( k
= 5 \) to \( k = 6 \). We first consider \( 5 \times 5 \) board and
extend it on the right and bottom to make a \( 6 \times 6 \) board.

We call the \( 11 \) new cells in the extended part of the board
(shown as dashed cells below) as *new cells*. We call the \( 16 \)
cells of the original board (shown as solid cells below) as *old
cells*.

* Case 1: Number of ways to place both knights on the new cells.
* Case 2: Number of ways to place exactly one knight on a new cell.
  * Type A: New cells near old corner cells.
  * Type B: New cells next to cells of type A.
  * Type C: Remaining new cells.

We will also obtain general formulas in terms of \( k \) where \( k \)
is the size of the extended board and \( k \ge 5 \).
