## Legend

* In the chart on the left, each level of indentation represents
recursion depth.

* The first number in each row represents the choice (whether to add
or subtract) made for each element.

* The second parenthesized number represents the current `diff`
computed as a result of all the choices made in the current call and
preceding calls.

## Algorithm

* The solution function calls itself recursively.

* In each call it receives the entire sequence of numbers, the index
of the element in the sequence that we need to work on, and the `diff`
computed so far for the previous elements. We call the indexed element
as the current element.

* There are two possible choices to be made now for the
current element:
  * Add the current element to the `diff`.
  * Subtract the current element from the `diff`.

* For each choice, call the solution function recursively with an
updated `diff` and the index incremented by 1.
