# Coin Piles: Necessary Conditions for Emptying Both Piles

## First Necessary Condition: \( 3 \mid (a + b) \)

Let \( a \) and \( b \) be the number of coins in the two piles.
Without loss of generality, assume \( a \le b \).

In every move, we remove a total of \( 3 \) coins from both piles. If
the pile becomes empty after an integer number of moves, \( a + b \)
must be a multiple of 3, i.e., \( 3 \mid (a + b) \).


## Second Necessary Condition: \( a \ge b/2 \)

If \( a < b/2 \), both piles cannot become empty. Even if we remove
only \( 1 \) coin from the first pile in every move, after \( a \)
moves, the first pile will be empty but the second pile will contain
\( b - 2a > 0 \) coins left.
