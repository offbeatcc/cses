# Tower of Hanoi: Minimum Number of Moves

## Reference

Concrete Mathematics, 2nd ed. (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik, 1994).


## Definition

Let \( T_n \) be the minimum number of moves required to solve Tower
of Hanoi with \( n \) discs.


## \( 2T_{n - 1} + 1 \) Moves Suffice

We have \( T_0 = 0 \). For \( n > 0 \), we have

\[ T_n \le 2T_{n - 1} + 1 \]

because we first move \( n - 1 \) discs to the spare peg thus
consuming \( T_{n - 1} \) moves, then we move disc \( n \) to the
target peg thus consuming \( 1 \) move, and finally we move \( n - 1
\) discs from the spare peg to the target peg thus consuming another
\( T_{n - 1} \) moves.


## \( 2T_{n - 1} + 1 \) Moves Necessary

At some point we need to move the largest disc (i.e., disc \( n \)) to
the target peg. At that time the remaining \( n - 1 \) discs must be
on the spare peg, and it has taken at least \( T_{n - 1} \) moves to
put them there.

The movement of the largest disc to the target peg consumes \( 1 \)
move.

Finally, we must move the remaining \( n - 1 \) discs from the spare
peg to the target peg. This consumes another \( T_{n - 1} \) moves.

Therefore for \( n > 0 \), we get

\[ T_n \ge 2T_{n - 1} + 1 \]


## Recurrence Relation

\[
T_n = \begin{cases}
  2T_{n-1} + 1 & \text{if } n > 0, \\
  0 & \text{if } n = 0.
\end{cases}
\]


## Examples

\begin{align*}
  T_0 &= 0, \\
  T_1 &= 1, \\
  T_2 &= 3, \\
  T_3 &= 7, \\
  T_4 &= 15, \\
  T_5 &= 31, \\
  &\;\,\vdots \\
  T_n &= 2^n - 1.
\end{align*}


## Proof by Induction

Since \( T_0 = 2^0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \), the induction basis holds.

Assume \( T_{n-1} = 2^{n - 1} - 1 \).

Then \( T_n = 2T_{n-1} + 1 = 2(2^{n - 1} - 1) + 1 = 2^n - 2 + 1 = 2^n
- 1 \).
