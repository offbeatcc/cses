## Reflect Method

Consider an alternating sequence of \( k \) repetitions of \( A \)
and \( k \) repetitions of \( B \), i.e.,
\( \underbrace{A, \dots, A}_{k \text{ times}},
   \underbrace{B, \dots, B}_{k \text{ times}},
   \underbrace{A, \dots, A}_{k \text{ times}},
   \underbrace{B, \dots, B}_{k \text{ times}},
   \dots. \)
Number the occurrence of each symbol by its position (0-based) in the
sequence.

If we pick all positions \( n \) such that <span class="em1">\(
\lfloor n/2k \rfloor \) is odd</span> and flip the symbols at those
positions, we get a reflected sequence of the symbols, i.e.,
\( \underbrace{A, \dots, A}_{k \text{ times}},
   \underbrace{B, \dots, B}_{k \text{ times}},
   \underbrace{B, \dots, B}_{k \text{ times}},
   \underbrace{A, \dots, A}_{k \text{ times}},
   \dots. \)

This follows directly from the previous board if we denote each group
of repetitions as \( A' = \underbrace{A, \dots, A}_{k \text{ times}}
\) and \( B' = \underbrace{B, \dots, B}_{k \text{ times}} \), then
number the alternating sequence groups, i.e., \(A', B', A', B', \dots
\), by their positions (0-based), and then note that the \( n \)th
symbol belongs to the \( \lfloor n / k \rfloor \)th group.
