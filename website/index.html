      The primary reference resources for these meetings are
      the <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/">CSES Problem Set</a>
      and <a href="https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf">Competitive
      Programmer's Handbook (Antti Laaksonen)</a>. Both resources are
      freely available on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      These meetings are hosted
      by <a href="https://github.com/susam">Susam</a> from
      the <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#offbeat">#offbeat</a>
      channel of Libera IRC network. These meetings will likely be
      attended by some members of this channel, other related
      channels, as well as by some members
      from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These meetings are open to anyone who is willing to join and
      study the reference book and the problem set with us. Note that
      silently lurking is considered absolutely fine in our meetings.
      In fact, most members of the club join in and stay silent
      throughout the meetings. Only a few members talk via audio/video
      or chat. This is considered absolutely normal in our meetings,
      so please do not hesitate to join our meetings!
