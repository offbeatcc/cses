17:12 cherim: For large n, almost all permutations are valid answers: their fraction is 1-2/n^2 + O(1/n^3).
17:12 Nazarii: that is interesting analysis, I've just accidentally chose to start with (n-1) like in the first example test case
17:12 cherim: A later problem
17:12 cherim: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1075/
17:12 cherim: asks for the exact number.
17:18 Lorenzo: Very interesting cherim, thanks for sharing
17:18 cherim: There are also solutions that do not insist on even/odd separation. Say, interleaving 1,2,3... and n/2, n/2+1, n/2+2,...
