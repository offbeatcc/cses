16:55 traxex: hello world
16:56 Sam: goodbye world
16:56 traxex: never used jitsi before but seems to work great
16:57 _BraveMen: hello
16:57 Chris: Hi
16:57 Sam: everyone coming from lobsters?
16:57 _BraveMen: from lobster
16:57 Chris: yea
16:58 traxex: I'm from IRC
16:59 Sam: i like the noises
16:59 Trent: whooop whooop whoop
17:00 _BraveMen: ðŸ˜„
17:10 Lorenzo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture
17:10 Lorenzo: we're guaranteed to reach one for number below 10^a lot
17:10 Lorenzo: for all numbers below 2.95Ã—10^20, so 10^6 is fine
17:11 traxex: I'd suggest using assert(1<=n && n<=1e6); instead of a comment
17:12 Lorenzo: What happens if at some point 3*n+1 overflows at some point? Are we sure it won't for all starting numbers below 10^6?
17:13 traxex: that's a good point ðŸ˜ƒ
17:13 traxex: I think it's the point of this problem on CSES
17:13 traxex: you need to use 64-bit integers
17:17 Lorenzo: I think if the string is empty we should return 0, not 1
17:17 Lorenzo: Oh never mind, sorry
17:20 traxex: true, but the Constraints say it's not empty
17:20 traxex: it's important that n is long long
17:20 traxex: it's not enough for s to be long long here
17:20 traxex: n*(n+1) depends on the type of n
17:22 zgrep: Would the compiler optimize the order of multiplication/division to lessen the likelihood of overflow?
17:23 paul: I don't think it's allowed to
17:23 vk: No.
17:24 traxex: if you had "int n", the multiplicatrion would overflow
17:24 traxex: even though s is long long
17:24 traxex: yes you could cast
17:24 delsqx: that would be the same as having it as long long?
17:24 paul: For that expression, yes
17:24 Lorenzo: We could use the closed formula for the xor of all numbers from 1 to n, instead of the sum, if we wanted to use int.
17:25 vik: yes
17:25 traxex: that's a cute idea
17:30 cherim: The overflow discussion was even more relevant in "Weird Algorithm". How do you know that your current submission is correct (doesn't overflow 64 bits on n<=1e6 inputs not included in the CSES tests)?
17:31 traxex: yes, the first chat messages about overflow were about Weird Algorithm
17:32 cherim: Yes, testing all n<=1e6 "at home" is the best way (and a necessary part of the solution).
17:32 traxex: has anyone checked what's the smallest n where 64 bits is not enough?
17:35 delsqx: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1121264/collatz-conjecture-largest-number-in-sequence-with-starting-number-n
17:36 traxex: for 64 bits you could maybe do an exhaustive search
17:39 cherim: http://www.ericr.nl/wondrous/pathrecs.html
17:39 traxex: yep that's enough
17:40 Sam: That was great, thank you ðŸ˜ƒ
17:40 fengshaun: Thanks
17:40 Trent: ty
17:40 Antriani: Thank you!
17:41 Nazarii: thank you ðŸ‘‹ see you tomorrow
17:41 subwoofer: ty
17:41 Lorenzo: 12327829503
17:41 RichardParker: Thank you
17:41 vik: byebye
17:41 chris: Thanks a lot, realy appreciate your effort
17:41 sechmo: thanks :3
17:41 Mohsen: ty ðŸ˜ƒ
17:41 zgrep: Thank you!
17:41 Lorenzo: @trarex I think 12327829503 is the smallest, see
